# Working Directory Management with "Here"" and Markdown Loops with "Gluedown"
## A demonstration project for the 5/13/2022 R users group at CDPHE.

This project shows two cool things:

* First, it shows how to use the "here" package and a pair of accessory functions to manage your working directory more robustly. This is especially helpful when you are sharing projecs across github.

* Second it shows how to use loops within an Rmarkdown document to generate reports with iterative elements. This uses the package "gluedown."

Both are neat and fun to share!
